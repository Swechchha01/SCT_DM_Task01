 Task 03: Competitor Social Media Strategy Analysis
Brand Name (Fictional): GlowMuse
Industry: Skincare & Beauty for Gen Z

🔍 Competitor 1: Mamaearth India
Platform: Instagram (@mamaearth.in)

Posting Frequency: 5–6 posts per week

📌 Engagement Tactics:
Influencer marketing with relatable creators

UGC (User Generated Content) reposts

Sustainable campaigns (e.g., tree-planting initiatives)

Trending reel formats using music, transitions

🎨 Content Style:
Warm, clean aesthetic (green, white, earthy tones)

Real testimonials, natural ingredient visuals

Friendly, authentic messaging with emotional appeal

🔍 Competitor 2: Plum Goodness
Platform: Instagram (@plumgoodness)

Posting Frequency: 4–5 posts per week

📌 Engagement Tactics:
Caption contests, giveaways

Fun polls & quizzes in Stories

Reels using trending audio with product education

Collaborations with Gen Z influencers

🎨 Content Style:
Minimalist pastel palette

Fresh, clean visuals and product flat lays

Funny captions, trendy meme-style Reels

Light, approachable, and casual tone

✅ Strategic Summary: How GlowMuse Can Stand Out
While Mamaearth focuses on sustainability and Plum targets fun + minimalism, GlowMuse can position itself as a bold, empowering, and unfiltered skincare brand for Gen Z girls who value self-love, honesty, and aesthetics.

💡 Key Learnings from Competitors:
Both brands effectively use Instagram Reels for engagement

UGC + Influencer campaigns are essential for trust and visibility

Interactive stories (polls, quizzes) boost engagement

Consistency and community messaging build brand loyalty

🚀 Differentiation Ideas for GlowMuse:
Use bold Gen Z-friendly language with memes, real-skin closeups

Launch a “#NoFilterGlow” campaign showing real, unedited selfies

Collaborate with nano-influencers (10k–50k followers) for trust

Share skincare confessions or “skin fails” with educational tips

Add GlowMuse Diaries: weekly glow-up stories from real users

Focus heavily on short videos with relatable, humorous audio

📌 Conclusion:
By mixing confidence, relatability, and bold Gen Z energy, GlowMuse can carve its own identity in a competitive skincare market. Instead of soft and minimal, GlowMuse will be loud, honest, and unapologetically real.
